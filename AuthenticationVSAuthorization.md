Authentication = "Who are you?"

It confirms your identity.
It's the process of verifying who a user is.

Usually done via:
Username + password
OTP
Biometrics (fingerprint, face ID)
OAuth (Login with Google/Facebook, etc.)

Eexample:
Showing your ID card at the airport check-in. Youâ€™re proving who you are.

Authorization = "What are you allowed to do?"

It defines what you can access or do.
Happens after authentication.
Determines what actions or resources a user is allowed to access.

Example: Can the user:
View the dashboard?
Edit a post?
Delete a user?

Example:
After check-in, your boarding pass says which flight and seat you're allowed to access. That's authorization.
